# Image-Captioning-by-Attention
🌟 Image Captioning Using Attention Mechanism

✨ Overview

This project focuses on generating descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. It leverages VGG16 for feature extraction, LSTM for sequence modeling, and an attention mechanism to enhance contextual understanding. The implementation is done using Google Colab for ease of execution and GPU acceleration.

🔧 Key Features

💡 Feature Extraction: Uses VGG16 (pretrained on ImageNet) to extract meaningful visual features.

👨‍👩‍👦 Sequence Modeling: Captions are generated using LSTM-based decoder.

🔄 Attention Mechanism: Focuses on key image regions dynamically for better captioning.

🎯 Dataset Support: Works with MS-COCO, Flickr8k, and Flickr30k datasets.

✅ Google Colab Ready: Code is optimized for Colab with GPU acceleration.
